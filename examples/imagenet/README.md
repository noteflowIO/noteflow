# Image Classifier Example
This example notebook demonstrates how to 
- create a flow with **supporting files**
- create a flow that uploads and processes an image file
- return predictions against a pre-trained model

## To upload
To create this flow, simple select **"New Flow"** (you must be logged-in to create new flows)

- enter a name and description of your choosing
- upload `Image Net.ipynb` into the **Notebook** field
- upload both `imagenet_classes.txt` and `shufflenetv2_x1-5666bf0f80.pth` into the **Supporting Files** field
- select **Create**

## To run
After creating your flow, simply select the flow from the [home page](https://noteflow.app/)
- upload an input image into the upload field
- select **Run**
